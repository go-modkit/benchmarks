# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

Use GitHub Security Advisories for private disclosure:

- https://github.com/go-modkit/benchmarks/security/advisories/new

If private advisories are unavailable, open a discussion asking maintainers for a private contact channel without disclosing exploit details.

## What to include

- impacted component(s)
- reproduction steps
- potential impact
- suggested mitigation (optional)

## Disclosure policy

- We acknowledge reports as soon as possible.
- We prioritize fixes by severity and exploitability.
- We publish fixes and advisories after remediation is available.
